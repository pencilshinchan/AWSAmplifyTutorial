# Authorization JavaScript code

The code will be (mostly) supplied for the Auth pages. We will look at the SignUp page first, and based on it's code we will update the SignIn page code. Other pages such as ForgotPassword, ConfirmSignUp and the ErrorNotification component will be supplied. This is showing a basic workflow with a username and password, and would have to be altered both in code AND in the CLI to support a different workflow.

## Create Files

Code will be supplied via links to github gists. Javascript files will be created in the project and code from the gists can be copied to the appropriate files.

In the project under the create the directory src/api/auth - create 5 files in the directory
- ErrorNotification.js
- SignUp.js
- ConfirmSignUp.js
- SignIn.js
- ForgotPassword.js
