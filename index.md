## AWS Amplify Basic Tutorial

This is a basic tutorial for AWS Amplify that will concentrate on the Auth and API that will be added via the Amplify CLI

A simple, but somewhat contrived example of a purchase order system will be created.

### First things first

Before we can do anything you will require an AWS account, and all software and packages need to be installed and configured.
